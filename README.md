Please follow the steps below careful to be able to compile the code.

### Step 1: Create local.properties

### Step 2: Add this your SDK directory to your project

auth_token= "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhcGlrZXkiOiJiZDNhNGE0NC00NmY3LTQ1NjMtOTQ4Ni1hNjY5MDZjNzM4YjMiLCJwZXJtaXNzaW9ucyI6WyJhbGxvd19qb2luIl0sImlhdCI6MTY1NzA0ODAzNSwiZXhwIjoxNjU3NjUyODM1fQ.LVDPAhUpLw97ZT5KcGrcEF_jCxzICnIU-lMC7YICyxI"

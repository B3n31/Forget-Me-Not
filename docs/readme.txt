# Line length
The length of the line should not exceeds 80 characters long.

# Naming convention
You may only use the letter a-z, the captial A-Z, and the number 0-9, and the underscore character '_'.

You may not start a variable name with a number.

We will use lower camel Case which means that the first letter of the word is lowercase, and any subsequent word is captialized.

#Comments
Comment should explain what is not obvious from the code itself.

Keep the comment clear and precise. Try to not express it in a long sentence.
